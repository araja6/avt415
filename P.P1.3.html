<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Mona has just moved into a new house, she is thinking of ways to decorate her space and wants to add some indoor plants. She also has a backyard and wants to make a vegetable garden. She does not know much about plants and because of this she is very overwhelmed by the selection. One day while Mona is researching different plants she comes across Leafy an online plant store that provides all the tools needed for indoor plants as well as gardening. While shopping and looking at plants, she can also learn about their needs and see which one fits her lifestyle best. She decides to look at plants that are more low maintenance, because she works full time, and love sunlight, because her house has many windows. Through this she was able to pick the perfect plants for her space as well as learn how to take care of them. She also didnâ€™t have to go to a separate store for her gardening supplies and seeds and was able to find everything she needed to start gardening.</p>
<p>While shopping on Leafy she was also able to choose plant pots that matched the color scheme of her house, and she was able to get a gardening tool kit, that included gloves, a shovel, and a hat. The website also gave information on what soil would be best for her garden depending on her plants, what season they thrive in, and how long it would take to reach harvest. Everything that she was unsure about was resolved because all the information and products she needed were found on Leafy.</p>
